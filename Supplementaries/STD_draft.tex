\newpage
This section (Fig \ref{Supp_disparity_all_Mammaliaformes}, \ref{Supp_disparity_all_Eutheria}, \ref{Supp_disparity_all_Mammaliaformes_rarefied} and \ref{Supp_disparity_all_Eutheria_rarefied}) contains the results of the analysis of the Mammaliaformes and Eutherian data set with all the disparity measurements and methods for sampling disparity through time.
The different disparity measurements are the median distance from centroid (see methods section in the main text for details) as well as the median sum and products of ranges and variances from \cite{Wills1994}.
The different methods for sampling disparity through time are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Intervals (tips only)}. We selected every tips present at every stages from the early Middle Jurassic (Bajocian, starting at 170.3 Mya) to the present. We collapsed together every stage containing less than 3 tips. Note that some tips where present in multiple stages due to their occurrence data (see methods section in the main text for details on the occurrence data).
\item \textbf{Intervals (tips and nodes)}. We selected every stage tips and nodes present at every stages from the early Middle Jurassic (Bajocian, starting at 170.3 Mya) to the present. We collapsed together every stage containing less than 3 elements (tips and/or nodes).
\item \textbf{Slices (punctuated)}. These are the results presented in the main text where time is sample equidistantly and evolution is assumed to be punctuated (randomly selecting either data from the descendant or the ancestor when slicing through a branch; see methods section in the main text for details).
\item \textbf{Slices (punctuated: acctran)}. Similar as slices (punctuated) method but data is always selected from the descendant (see methods section in the main text for details).
\item \textbf{Slices (punctuated: deltran)}. Similar as slices (punctuated) method but data is always selected from the ancestor (see methods section in the main text for details).
\item \textbf{Slices (gradual)}. SThese are the results presented in the main text where time is sample equidistantly and evolution is assumed to be gradual (data is selected from the descendant or the ancestor based on branch length; see methods section in the main text for details).
\end{enumerate}
We also rarefied both data sets for all the metrics and all the methods using only 3 taxa for the interval methods and 8 taxa for the slices methods.
