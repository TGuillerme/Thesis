This thesis would not have been as enjoyable to put together without the help of the people mentioned below.
%Natalie Cooper for kind of everything
It would have not been possible at all, however, without the devotion of my supervisor Natalie Cooper.
Thank you for the countless time you spent patiently helping/coaching/teaching/mentoring me but also for being always motivated and positive about this whole project (especially when it wasn't going as planned).
I've learned a lot from working with you both in terms of skills and of the attitude to have regarding academia and am ever grateful for both.

%Academic help
Other people also brought invaluable insight to this thesis:
Andrew Jackson who was always around chatting about the latest Mortal Kombat test or a new fancy statistical move (or the other way around);
Gavin Thomas for kindly spending time commenting on my projects (especially Chapter \ref{chap:TEM_paper});
Graeme Lloyd for the fast and enthusiastic responses to my questions (especially Chapter \ref{chap:STD_paper});
Rich FitzJohn for enforcing his strict, yet crucial, coding best practices (and for providing this thesis template);
Trevor Hodkinson and Paula Murphy for following me through the thesis Steering Committee;
Dave Bapst, Nick Matzke, April Wright and the people from the Macro JC for providing a fertile ground for new ideas.

%Academic support
A great thanks also to my office mates, Sive Finlay (PhD deirfi\'{u}r), Kevin Healy, Adam Kane and ``Marvin'' Qiang Yang for kindly supporting my random Frenchings.
Excellent support also came from the staff, post-docs and students of the School of Natural Sciences who made me feel at home since day one in Ireland:
Mirjam Ansorge, Yvonne Buckley, Joe Colgan, Luca Coscieme, Shaun Coutts, Ian Donohue, Alain Finn, Dave Kelly, Se\'{a}n Kelly, Deirdre McClean, Keith McMahon, Conor Owens, Maureen Williams, Mike Whitfield and all the NERD club members.

%French people
People from the Universit\'{e} Montpellier 2 are also to be accounted for much in my motivation to undertake a PhD:% in the first place
Julien Claude, Fr\'{e}d\'{e}ric Delsuc, Emmanuel Douzery and Laurent Marivaux;
and, of course, Franck Barbi\`{e}re, S\'{e}bastien Enault, Sylvain Monteux, Morgan Le Ny, Benjamin Ramassamy and all the other friends from the masters as well.

%Family
And finally, I'd like to thank my folks, Marja, Jean-Philippe, Nina and Daan for not always understanding what all that was about (and asking me to explain more clearly) but still always supporting my decision to undertake long and non-applied studies.
This PhD was funded by the Trinity Postgraduate Research Studentship.% and the faculty of science engineering and maths and the European Commission CORDIS Seventh Framework Programme 772 (FP7) Marie Curie CIG grant (proposal number: 321696) provided funding for the research expenses.

%Just put the trinity funding here. Keep it one page long.
