\subsection{Morphological characters states}
In order to obtain a realistic probabilistic value for of \textit{k} characters states for each simulated morphological character, we downloaded 100 random morphological characters (with more than 100 characters each) from TreeBASE database (http://treebase.org/) published between 1985 and 2013 and covering 19 taxomomic classess (Chordata, Arthropoda, Annelida, Angiosperm, Gymnosperm and Pteridophyta).
We selected a total of 22563 characters ranging from 2 to 10 states.
We calculated the proportion of characters with 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 states.
We then sampeled 22563 \textit{k} values between 2 and 10 with the same proportion of characters from the empirical data.
We then used a simple t-test to check if our simulation was equal to the empirical data.
In this study, we only simulated characters with 2 or 3 states because of the high proportion of ordered characters ecountered on characters with more than 3 states and the difficulties of simulate biologicaly sensible ordered characters.
