\section{We all love a few equations}
We like to put in some equations for a bit of fun.
where $\lambda_i$ is the speciation rate in state $i$, $\mu_i$ is the
extinction rate in state $i$, and $q_{ij}$ is the rate of transition
from state $i$ to $j$ forward in time.

\section{Results}
We briefly present the results of our lab work and equations
