\hline

\textbf{Abbreviation} & \textbf{Measurement} & \textbf{Description}\\
\hline
CB & Condylobasal length & Total skull length from the front of the premaxillary  bones to the rear of the occipital condyles, measured from below \\
%-------------------------------------------
PL & Palate length & Maximum length of the palate from the anterior of the pre-maxilla to the posterior of the hard palate\\
%----------------------------------------------
TR & Tooth row length & From the front of the alveolus of the first incisor to the rear of the alveolus of the last molar on the same side\\
%----------------------------------------------
PWa* & Palate width anterior & Width across the palate measured between the posterior, outer-most points of the alveoli of the first pair of teeth\\
%I had to modify this measurement slightly for some species: when there was a row of anterior incisors which stretch across the front of the palate (e.g. Euroscaptor klossi SI_261090) then I measured PWa as the width across from back of the row of the incisors on either side (i.e. just in front of the canines) 
%----------------------------------------
maxPW & Maximum palate width & Measured at the widest point of the palate\\
%--------------------------------------------
IncisorH* & Incisor height & Maximum height of the first incisor on the right\\
%----------------------------------------
ZW & Zygomatic width & Maximum width between the zygomatic arches (measured within the arches from below the skull)\\
%---------------------------------------
MX & Maxilla width & Width between the maxillary bones, measured from above the skull. Species with zygomatic arches; width from the innermost connection between the anterior of the arch and the skull. No arches; width between the anterior skull constrictions.\\ 
%---------------------------------------
SQ & Squamosal width & Width between the squamosal bones, measured from above the skull. Species with zygomatic arches; width from the innermost connection between the posterior of the arch and the skull. No arches; width between the posterior skull constrictions \\
%-------------------------
OL & Orbit length & Longitudinal length of the orbit opening measured along the edge of the skull from the maxilla to the squamosal. \\
%------------------------------
IFD* & Interorbital foramen width & The maximum (vertical) diameter of the right interorbital foramen\\
%-----------------------------------------------
IFW & Interorbital foramen width & Maximum width across the skull between the two interorbital foramina, measured from above\\
%-------------------------------
IFcanal* & Interorbital foramen canal & Length of the right IF canal measured between the anterior and posterior openings from above\\
%---------------------------------
BW & Braincase width & Width across the braincase at the widest point of the skull\\
%---------------------------------
SkH & Skull height & Perpendicular height from the highest point on the braincase to the base of the skull\\
