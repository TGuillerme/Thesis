I am very lucky to have worked in a great Department with the support and encouragement of many staff, students and collaborators. Most importantly, thank you to my supervisor, Natalie Cooper for her mentoring, teaching, advice and support at every stage of my studies. 

Thank you to the Zoology postgraduate students and staff for their advice, comradery and friendship. Thanks in particular to my "PhD fr\`{e}re", Thomas Guillerme, office-mates Adam Kane and Kevin Healy, their supervisor Andrew Jackson and surrogate office members Deirdre McClean and Se\'{a}n Kelly for help and support with countless issues and for generally brightening up every day.

I received excellent suggestions, advice and guidance from many collaborators. Thanks to the members of NERD club and to the delegates at the BES Macro meetings for their discussions and feedback. Thanks also to Fran\c{c}ois Gould for being my morphometrics guru and to Rich FitzJohn for providing his LaTeX thesis template. 

Thank you to the museum staff and curators for facilitating my access to their collections: Leona Leonard and Nigel Monaghan (National Museum of Ireland, Natural History), Roberto Portela Miguez and Paula Jenkins (Natural History Museum, London), Esther Langan (Smithsonian Institute), Eileen Westwig (American Museum of Natural History), Judy Chupasko (Museum of Comparative Zoology) and Bill Stanley and Steve Goodman (Field Museum). This work was enabled by generous financial support from the Irish Research Council.

Finally, thank you to my family for their interest in all things tenrec-related. Thanks especially to my parents for their constant support and vielen Dank to Chris for everything.
