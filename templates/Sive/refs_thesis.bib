  abstract = {Many questions in evolutionary biology require the quantification
	and comparison of rates of phenotypic evolution. Recently, phylogenetic
	comparative methods have been developed for comparing evolutionary
	rates on a phylogeny for single, univariate traits (&#x3C3;(2)),
	and evolutionary rate matrices (R) for sets of traits treated simultaneously.
	However, high-dimensional traits like shape remain under-examined
	with this framework, because methods suited for such data have not
	been fully developed. In this article, I describe a method to quantify
	phylogenetic evolutionary rates for high-dimensional multivariate
	data , found from the equivalency between statistical methods based
	on covariance matrices and those based on distance matrices (R-mode
	and Q-mode methods). I then use simulations to evaluate the statistical
	performance of hypothesis-testing procedures that compare for two
	or more groups of species on a phylogeny. Under both isotropic and
	non-isotropic conditions, and for differing numbers of trait dimensions,
	the proposed method displays appropriate Type I error and high statistical
	power for detecting known differences in among groups. In contrast,
	the Type I error rate of likelihood tests based on the evolutionary
	rate matrix (R) increases as the number of trait dimensions (p) increases,
	and becomes unacceptably large when only a few trait dimensions are
	considered. Further, likelihood tests based on R cannot be computed
	when the number of trait dimensions equals or exceeds the number
	of taxa in the phylogeny (i.e., when p&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;N).
	These results demonstrate that tests based on provide a useful means
	of comparing evolutionary rates for high-dimensional data that are
	otherwise not analytically accessible to methods based on the evolutionary
	rate matrix. This advance thus expands the phylogenetic comparative
	toolkit for high-dimensional phenotypic traits like shape. Finally,
	I illustrate the utility of the new approach by evaluating rates
	of head shape evolution in a lineage of Plethodon salamanders. [Evolutionary

  abstract = {Many evolutionary studies require an understanding of phenotypic change.
	However, while analyses of phenotypic variation across pairs of evolutionary
	levels (populations or time steps) are well established, methods
	for testing hypotheses that compare evolutionary sequences across
	multiple levels are less developed. Here we describe a general analytical
	procedure for quantifying and comparing patterns of phenotypic evolution.
	The phenotypic evolution of a lineage is defined as a trajectory
	across a set of evolutionary levels in a multivariate phenotype space.
	Attributes of these trajectories (their size, direction, and shape),
	are quantified, and statistically compared across pairs of taxa,
	and a summary statistic is used to determine the extent to which
	patterns of phenotypic evolution are concordant across multiple taxa.
	This approach provides a direct quantitative description of how patterns
	of phenotypic evolution differ, as well as a statistical assessment
	of the degree of repeatability in the evolutionary responses to selection
	among taxa. We describe how this approach can quantify phenotypic
	trajectories from many ecological and evolutionary processes, whose
	data encode multivariate characterizations of the phenotype, including:
	phenotypic plasticity, ecological selection, ontogeny and growth,
	local adaptation, and biomechanics. We illustrate the approach by
	examining the phenotypic evolution of several fossil lineages of
	Globorotalia.},

  abstract = {Ecological character displacement describes a pattern where morphological
	differences between sympatric species are enhanced through interspecific
	competition. Although widely considered a pervasive force in evolutionary
	ecology, few clear-cut examples have been documented. Here we report
	a case of ecological character displacement between two salamander
	species, Plethodon cinereus and Plethodon hoffmani. Morphology was
	quantified by using linear measurements and landmark-based geometric
	morphometric methods for specimens from allopatric and sympatric
	populations from two geographic transects in south-central Pennsylvania,
	and stomach contents were assayed to quantify food resource use.
	Morphological variation was also assessed in 13 additional allopatric
	populations. In both transects, we found significant morphological
	differentiation between sympatric populations that was associated
	with a reduction in prey consumption in sympatry and a segregation
	of prey according to prey size. No trophic morphological or resource
	use differences were found between allopatric populations, and comparisons
	of sympatric populations with randomly paired allopatric populations
	revealed that the observed sympatric morphological differentiation
	was greater than expected by chance. The major trophic anatomical
	differences between sympatric populations relates to functional and
	biomechanical differences in jaw closure: sympatric P. hoffmani have
	a faster closing jaw, whereas sympatric P. cinereus have a slower,
	stronger jaw. Because salamanders immobilize prey of different sizes
	in different ways, and because the observed sympatric biomechanical
	differences in jaw closure are associated with the differences in
	prey consumption, the observed character displacement has a functional
	ecological correlate, and we can link changes in form with changes
	in function in this apparent example of character displacement.},

	geographical range sizes (GRSs) in mammals spans 12 orders of magnitude.
	A long-standing macroecological model of this diversity holds that
	as body size increases, species are increasingly restricted to occupying
	larger GRS. Here, we show that the body size-GRS relationship is
	more complex than previously recognized. Our study reveals that the
	positive relationship between body size and GRS does not hold across
	the entire size range of mammals. Instead, there is a break point
	in the relationship around the modal mammal body size. For species
	smaller than the mode, GRS actually decreases with body size. We
	discuss mechanisms to account for these observations in the context
	of the energetics of body size. We also examine the possibility that
	the patterns are the result of a statistical artefact from combining
	two random, uni-modal, skewed distributions, but conclude that the
	patterns we describe are not artefactual. Our results redefine our

  abstract = {Background and AimsConvergent evolution is invoked to explain similarity
	between unrelated organisms in similar environments, but most evaluations
	of convergence analyse similarity of organismal attributes rather
	than of the environment. This study focuses on the globular succulent
	plants of the Americas, the cacti, and their counterparts in Africa
	in the ice-plant, spurge and milkweed families. Though often held
	up as paragons of convergent morphological evolution, the environmental
	similarity of these plants has remained largely unexamined from a
	quantitative perspective.MethodsFive hotspots (centres of high species
	diversity of globular succulents) were selected, two in Mexico and
	three in South Africa. Their environments were compared using niche
	modelling tools, randomization tests of niche similarity and multivariate
	analyses to test for environmental similarity.Key ResultsAlthough
	the sites selected have 'similar' but unrelated life forms, almost
	all our results highlighted more climate differences than similarities
	between the hotspots. Interprediction of niches within and between
	continents, a niche equivalence test, and MANOVA results showed significant
	differences. In contrast, a niche similarity test showed that the
	comparisons of Cuatroci&#xE9;negas-Richtersveld, Huizache-Knersvlakte
	and Huizache-Richtersveld were similar.ConclusionsDifferences in
	rainfall and temperature regimes and the potential effect of edaphic
	factors may be involved in the differences between the hotspots.
	In addition, differences in structure, morphology and physiology
	of the globular succulents may coincide with some of the climatic
	dissimilarities; i.e. given convergence as the evolution of similar
	morphologies under similar conditions, then it may be that differing
	environments diagnose inconspicuous morphological differences. Moreover,
	although fine-scale differences between sites were found, a coarser
	perspective shows that these sites are clearly similar as drylands
	with relatively moderate drought and mild temperatures, illustrating
	how all studies of convergence must address the issue of how similar
	two entities must be before they are considered convergent.},

  abstract = {Abstract Background The Maximal Pairing Problem (MPP) is the prototype
	of a class of combinatorial optimization problems that are of considerable
	interest in bioinformatics: Given an arbitrary phylogenetic tree
	T and weights &#969; xy for the paths between any two pairs of leaves
	(x, y), what is the collection of edge-disjoint paths between pairs
	of leaves that maximizes the total weight? Special cases of the MPP
	for binary trees and equal weights have been described previously;
	algorithms to solve the general MPP are still missing, however. Results
	We describe a relatively simple dynamic programming algorithm for
	the special case of binary trees. We then show that the general case
	of multifurcating trees can be treated by interleaving solutions
	to certain auxiliary Maximum Weighted Matching problems with an extension
	of this dynamic programming approach, resulting in an overall polynomial-time
	solution of complexity (n 4 log n) w.r.t. the number n of leaves.
	The source code of a C implementation can be obtained under the GNU
	Public License from http://www.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/Software/Targeting.
	For binary trees, we furthermore discuss several constrained variants
	of the MPP as well as a partition function approach to the probabilistic
	version of the MPP. Conclusions The algorithms introduced here make
	it possible to solve the MPP also for large trees with high-degree
	vertices. This has practical relevance in the field of comparative
	phylogenetics and, for example, in the context of phylogenetic targeting,
	i.e., data collection with resource limitations.},

  number = {14},
  abstract = {Background: Afrotheria comprises a newly recognized clade of mammals
	with strong molecular evidence for its monophyly. In contrast, morphological
	data uniting its diverse constituents, including elephants, sea cows,
	hyraxes, aardvarks, sengis, tenrecs and golden moles, have been difficult
	to identify. Here, we suggest relatively late eruption of the permanent
	dentition as a shared characteristic of afrotherian mammals. This
	characteristic and other features (such as vertebral anomalies and
	testicondy) recall the phenotype of a human genetic pathology (cleidocranial
	dysplasia), correlations with which have not been explored previously
	in the context of character evolution within the recently established
	phylogeny of living mammalian clades. Results: Although data on the
	absolute timing of eruption in sengis, golden moles and tenrecs are
	still unknown, craniometric comparisons for ontogenetic series of
	these taxa show that considerable skull growth takes place prior
	to the complete eruption of the permanent cheek teeth. Specimens
	showing less than half (sengis, golden moles) or two-thirds (tenrecs,
	hyraxes) of their permanent cheek teeth reach or exceed the median
	jaw length of conspecifics with a complete dentition. With few exceptions,
	afrotherians are closer to median adult jaw length with fewer erupted,
	permanent cheek teeth than comparable stages of non-afrotherians.
	Manatees (but not dugongs), elephants and hyraxes with known age
	data show eruption of permanent teeth late in ontogeny relative to
	other mammals. While the occurrence of delayed eruption, vertebral
	anomalies and other potential afrotherian synapomorphies resemble
	some symptoms of a human genetic pathology, these characteristics
	do not appear to covary significantly among mammalian clades. Conclusion:
	Morphological characteristics shared by such physically disparate
	animals such as elephants and golden moles are not easy to recognize,
	but are now known to include late eruption of permanent teeth, in
	addition to vertebral anomalies, testicondy and other features. Awareness
	of their possible genetic correlates promises insight into the developmental
	basis of shared morphological features of afrotherians and other

  abstract = {Gliding has evolved independently at least six times in mammals. Multiple
	hypotheses have been proposed to explain the evolution of gliding.
	These include the evasion of predators, economical locomotion or
	foraging, control of landing forces, and habitat structure. Here
	we use a combination of comparative methods and ecological and biomechanical
	data collected from free-ranging animals to evaluate these hypotheses.
	Our comparative data suggest that the origins of gliding are often
	associated with shifts to low-quality diets including leaves and
	plant exudates. Further, data from free-ranging colugos suggest that
	although gliding is not more energetically economical than moving
	through the canopy, it is much faster, allowing shorter times of
	transit between foraging patches and therefore more time available
	to forage in a given patch. In addition to moving quickly, gliding
	mammals spend only a small fraction of their overall time engaged
	in locomotion, likely offsetting its high cost. Kinetic data for
	both take-off and landing suggest that selection on these behaviors
	could also have shaped the evolution of gliding. Glides are initiated
	by high-velocity leaps that are potentially effective in evading
	arboreal predators. Further, upon landing, the ability to control
	aerodynamic forces and reduce velocity prior to impact is likely
	key to extending distances of leaps or glides while reducing the
	likelihood of injury. It is unlikely that any one of these hypotheses
	exclusively explains the evolution of gliding, but by examining gliding
	in multiple groups of extant animals in ecological and biomechanical
	contexts, new insights into the evolution of gliding can be gained.},

	between morphological change and phylogeny because sciurid skeletal
	characters are considered to be inclined to convergence. However,
	no morphological study involving all marmot species has ever been
	undertaken. Geometric morphometric techniques were applied in a comparative
	study of the marmot mandible. The adults of all 14 living marmot
	species were compared, and mean mandible shape were used to investigate
	morphological evolution in the genus Marmota. Three major trends
	were observed. First, the phylogenetic signal in the variation of
	landmark geometry, which describes mandible morphology, seems to
	account for the shape differences at intermediate taxonomic levels.
	The subgenera Marmota and Petromarmota, recently proposed on the
	basis of mitochondrial cytochrome b sequence, receive support from
	mandible morphology. When other sciurid genera were included in the
	analysis, the monophyly of the genus Marmota and that of the tribe
	Marmotini (i.e., marmots, prairie dogs, and ground squirrels) was
	strengthened by the morphological data. Second, the marmotine mandible
	may have evolved as a mosaic of characters and does not show convergence
	determined by size similarities. Third, allopatric speciation in
	peripheral isolates may have acted as a powerful force for modeling
	shape. This hypothesis is strongly supported by the peculiar mandible
	of M. vancouverensis and, to a lesser degree, by that of M. olympus,
	both thought to have originated as isolated populations in Pleistocene

	meliphagids. Instead, the Hawaiian species are divergent members
	of a passeridan group that includes deceptively dissimilar families
	of songbirds (Holarctic waxwings, neotropical silky flycatchers,
	and palm chats). Here we designate them as a new family, the Mohoidae.
	A nuclear-DNA rate calibration suggests that mohoids diverged from

  abstract = {Disparity, or morphological diversity, is often quantified by evolutionary
	biologists investigating the macroevolutionary history of clades
	over geological timescales. Disparity is typically quantified using
	proxies for morphology, such as measurements, discrete anatomical
	characters, or geometric morphometrics. If different proxies produce
	differing results, then the accurate quantification of disparity
	in deep time may be problematic. However, despite this, few studies
	have attempted to examine disparity of a single clade using multiple
	morphological proxies. Here, as a case study for this question, we
	examine the disparity of the volant Mesozoic fossil reptile clade
	Pterosauria, an intensively studied group that achieved substantial
	morphological, ecological and taxonomic diversity during their 145+
	million-year evolutionary history. We characterize broadscale patterns
	of cranial morphological disparity for pterosaurs for the first time
	using landmark-based geometric morphometrics and make comparisons
	to calculations of pterosaur disparity based on alternative metrics.
	Landmark-based disparity calculations suggest that monofenestratan
	pterosaurs were more diverse cranially than basal non-monofenestratan
	pterosaurs (at least when the aberrant anurognathids are excluded),
	and that peak cranial disparity may have occurred in the Early Cretaceous,
	relatively late in pterosaur evolution. Significantly, our cranial
	disparity results are broadly congruent with those based on whole
	skeleton discrete character and limb proportion data sets, indicating
	that these divergent approaches document a consistent pattern of
	pterosaur morphological evolution. Therefore, pterosaurs provide
	an exemplar case demonstrating that different proxies for morphological
	form can converge on the same disparity signal, which is encouraging
	because often only one such proxy is available for extinct clades
	represented by fossils. Furthermore, mapping phylogeny into cranial
	morphospace demonstrates that pterosaur cranial morphology is significantly
	correlated with, and potentially constrained by, phylogenetic relationships.},

	applied two tests for the assumption of Brownian motion that generally

	models for the evolution of traits in adaptive radiations. As a case

	We further quantified cranial disparity across eutherians and metatherians

	Data were analysed with principal components (PC) analysis, and three

  abstract = {SYNOPSIS. The long life spans of birds relative to those of mammals
	are intriguing to biogerontologists, particularly in light of birds'
	high body temperatures, high blood glucose levels, and high metabolic
	rates, all of which should theoretically increase their biochemical
	liability for rapid aging. The comparative longevity of birds and
	other flying homeotherms is consistent with evolutionary senescence
	theory, which posits that species with low mortality rates from predation
	or accident will be released from selection for rapid maturity and
	early reproduction, and will exhibit retarded aging. Comparative
	analyses of avian life history parameters to date, although not as
	extensive as those for mammals, broadly support an association between
	low mortality rates, slow reproduction, and long lifespan. The diversity
	of bird life histories suggests the importance of developing a diversity
	of avian models for studies of aging mechanisms, both proximate and
	ultimate, and for using wild as well as domestic representatives.
	Birds studied in the laboratory thus far show many of the same manifestations
	of aging as mammals, including humans, and many ornithologists are
	beginning to document actuarial evidence consistent with aging in
	their study populations. We encourage greater communication and collaboration
	among comparative gerontologists and ornithologists, in the hope
	that the study of aging in birds will lead to an integrated understanding
	of physiological aging processes well grounded in an evolutionary
	paradigm.},

  abstract = {G. Evelyn Hutchinson more than a half century ago proposed that one
	could characterize the ecological niche of a species as an abstract
	mapping of population dynamics onto an environmental space, the axes
	of which are abiotic and biotic factors that influence birth and
	death rates. If a habitat has conditions within a species' niche,
	a population should persist without immigration from external sources,
	whereas if conditions are outside the niche, it faces extinction.
	Analyses of species' niches are essential to understanding controls
	on species' geographical range limits and how these limits might
	shift in our rapidly changing world. Recent developments in ecology
	and evolutionary biology suggest it is time to revisit and refine
	Hutchinson's niche concept. After reviewing techniques for quantifying
	niches, I examine subtleties that arise because of impacts species
	have on their own environments, the density-dependent modulation
	of how individuals experience environments, and the interplay of
	dispersal and temporal heterogeneity in determining population persistence.
	Moreover, the evolutionary record over all time scales reveals a
	spectrum of rates of change in species' niches, from rapid niche
	evolution to profound niche conservatism. Substantial challenges
	revolving around the evolutionary dimension of the Hutchinsonian
	niche include quantifying the magnitude of evolved intraspecific
	and clade-level variation in niches and understanding the factors
	that govern where along the spectrum of potential evolutionary rates
	any given lineage lies. A growing body of theory provides elements
	of a conceptual framework for understanding niche conservatism and
	evolution, paving the way for an evolutionary theory of the niche.},

   abstract = {Although discordance between taxonomic diversity and morphological disparity is common, little is known about the underlying dynamics that drive this decoupling. Early in the history of the Cambrian trilobite family Pterocephaliidae, there was an increase in taxonomic diversity and morphological diversity. As taxonomic diversity declined in the later history of the clade, range of variation stayed high and disparity continued to increase. However, per-branch rates of morphological evolution estimated from a recent phylogeny decreased with time. Neither within-trait nor within-species variation increased or decreased, suggesting that the declining rates of morphological evolution were more likely related to ecological opportunity or niche partitioning, rather than increasing intrinsic constraints. This is further supported by evidence for increased biofacies associations throughout the time period. Thus, the high disparity seen at low taxonomic diversity late in the history of this clade was due to extinction - either random or targeting mean forms - rather than increased rates of morphological evolution. This pattern also provides a scenario that could account for instances of low taxonomic diversity but high morphological disparity in modern groups.},

	Similar scores are returned under two different species concepts,
	suggesting that the index is robust to taxonomic changes. The approach
	is applied to a near-complete species-level phylogeny of the Mammalia
	to generate a global priority list incorporating both phylogenetic
	diversity and extinction risk. The 100 highest-ranking species represent
	a high proportion of total mammalian diversity and include many species
	not usually recognised as conservation priorities. Many species that

	the sampling process, propagating it through to the derived metrics.
	3. Furthermore, we develop novel multivariate ellipse-based metrics

	the ellipses are unbiased with respect to sample size, and their
	estimation via Bayesian inference allows robust comparison to be
	made among data sets comprising different sample sizes. 4. These
	new metrics, which we call SIBER (Stable Isotope Bayesian Ellipses

	We have analyzed DA in the skeleton of the fox (V. vulpes), using
	&#x223C;1,000 radiographs of foxes from populations used in the genetic
	analysis of behavior and morphology. Careful measurements from this
	robust data base demonstrate that: 1) DA occurs in the limb bones,
	the ileum, and ischium and in the mandible; 2) regardless of the
	direction of the length asymmetry vector of a particular skeletal
	unit, the vectorial direction of length is always opposite to that
	of width; 3) with the exception of the humerus and radius, there
	is no correlation or inverse correlation between vectorial amplitudes
	or magnitudes of bone asymmetries. 4) Postnatal measurements on foxes
	demonstrate that the asymmetry increases after birth and continues
	to change (increasing or decreasing) during postnatal growth. 5)
	A behavior test for preferential use of a specific forelimb exhibited
	fluctuating asymmetry but not DA. None of the skeletal asymmetries
	were significantly correlated with a preferential use of a specific
	forelimb. We suggest that for the majority of fox skeletal parameters,
	growth on the right and left side of the fox are differentially biased
	resulting in fixed differences between the two sides in either the
	rate of growth or the length of the period during which growth occurs.
	Random effects around these fixed differences perturb the magnitude

  abstract = {Adaptive radiation refers to diversification from an ancestral species
	that produces descendants adapted to use a great variety of distinct
	ecological niches. In this review, I examine two aspects of adaptive
	radiation: first, that it results from ecological opportunity and,
	second, that it is deterministic in terms of its outcome and evolutionary
	trajectory. Ecological opportunity is usually a prerequisite for
	adaptive radiation, although in some cases, radiation can occur in
	the absence of preexisting opportunity. Nonetheless, many clades
	fail to radiate although seemingly in the presence of ecological
	opportunity; until methods are developed to identify and quantify
	ecological opportunity, the concept will have little predictive utility
	in understanding a priori when a clade might be expected to radiate.
	Although predicted by theory, replicated adaptive radiations occur
	only rarely, usually in closely related and poorly dispersing taxa
	found in the same region on islands or in lakes. Contingencies of
	a variety of types may usually preclude close similarity in the outcome
	of evolutionary diversification in other situations. Whether radiations
	usually unfold in the same general sequence is unclear because of
	the unreliability of methods requiring phylogenetic reconstruction
	of ancestral events. The synthesis of ecological, phylogenetic, experimental,
	and genomic advances promises to make the coming years a golden age
	for the study of adaptive radiation; natural history data, however,
	will always be crucial to understanding the forces shaping adaptation
	and evolutionary diversification.},

  abstract = {Many clades contain ecologically and phenotypically similar species
	across continents, yet the processes generating this similarity are
	largely unstudied, leaving fundamental questions unanswered. Is similarity
	in morphology and performance across assemblages caused by evolutionary
	convergence or by biogeographic dispersal of evolutionarily conserved
	ecotypes? Does convergence to new ecological conditions erase evidence
	of past adaptation? Here, we analyse ecology, morphology and performance
	in frog assemblages from three continents (Asia, Australia and South
	America), assessing the importance of dispersal and convergent evolution
	in explaining similarity across regions. We find three striking results.
	First, species using the same microhabitat type are highly similar
	in morphology and performance across both clades and continents.
	Second, some species on different continents owe their similarity
	to dispersal and evolutionary conservatism (rather than evolutionary
	convergence), even over vast temporal and spatial scales. Third,
	in one case, an ecologically specialized ancestor radiated into diverse
	ecotypes that have converged with those on other continents, largely
	erasing traces of past adaptation to their ancestral ecology. Overall,
	our study highlights the roles of both evolutionary conservatism
	and convergence in explaining similarity in species traits over large
	spatial and temporal scales and demonstrates a statistical framework
	for addressing these questions in other systems.},

	previous studies have focussed on skull morphology, so a vacuum exists
	about morphofunctional variation in postcranium and its role in structuring
	ensembles of felids in different continents. The African felid ensemble
	is particularly rich in ecologically specialized felids. We studied
	the ecomorphology of this ensemble using 31 cranial and 93 postcranial
	morphometric variables measured in 49 specimens of all 10 African
	species. We took a multivariate approach controlling for phylogeny,
	with and without body size correction. Postcranial and skull&#xA0;+&#xA0;postcranial
	analyses (but not skull-only analyses) allowed for a complete segregation
	of species in morphospace. Morphofunctional factors segregating species
	included body size, bite force, zeugopodial lengths and osteological
	features related to parasagittal leg movement. A general gradient
	of bodily proportions was recovered: lightly built, long-legged felids
	with small heads and weak bite forces vs. the opposite. Three loose
	groups were recognized: small terrestrial felids, mid-to-large sized
	scansorial felids and specialized Acinonyx jubatus and Leptailurus
	serval. As predicted from a previous study, the assembling of the
	African felid ensemble during the Plio-Pleistocene occurred by the
	arrival of distinct felid lineages that occupied then vacant areas
	of morphospace, later diversifying in the continent.}

	demonstrate that clumping in morphospace is possible even in the

	The quantitative definition of the BRW provides a means to analyze,

	mammals: lemurs, tenrecs, carnivorans, and rodents. These rank among
	the most spectacular examples of evolutionary diversification, but
	their monophyly and origins are debated. The lack of Tertiary fossils
	from Madagascar leaves molecular studies as most promising to solve
	these controversies. We provide a simultaneous reconstruction of
	phylogeny and age of the four radiations based on a 3.5-kb data set
	from three nuclear genes (ADRA2B, vWF, and AR). The analysis supports
	each as a monophyletic clade, sister to African taxa, and thereby
	identifies four events of colonization out of Africa. To infer the
	time windows for colonization, we take into account both the divergence
	from the closest noninsular sister group and the initial intrainsular
	radiation, which is a novel but conservative approach in studies
	of the colonization history of Madagascar. We estimate that lemurs
	colonized Madagascar between 60 million years ago (Mya) (split from
	lorises) and 50 Mya (lemur radiation) (70-41 Mya taking 95% credibility
	intervals into account), tenrecs between 42 and 25 Mya (50-20 Mya),
	carnivorans between 26 and 19 Mya (33-14 Mya), and rodents between
	24 and 20 Mya (30-15 Mya). These datings suggest at least two asynchronous
	colonization events: by lemurs in the Late Cretaceous-Middle Eocene,

	the feeding and locomotion systems of grunts (Haemulidae), a group
	of predominantly nocturnal fishes that live on both temperate and
	tropical reefs. Using phylogenetic comparative methods and statistical
	analyses that take into account uncertainty in phylogeny and the
	evolutionary history of reef living, we demonstrate that rates of
	morphological evolution are faster in reef-dwelling haemulids. The
	magnitude of this effect depends on the type of trait; on average,
	traits involved in the functional systems for prey capture and processing
	evolve twice as fast on reefs as locomotor traits. This result, along
	with the observation that haemulids do not exploit unique feeding
	niches on reefs, suggests that fine-scale trophic niche partitioning

	signal" in data sets composed of observations collected from species
	related by a phylogenetic tree. Phylogenetic signal is a measure
	of the statistical dependence among species' trait values due to
	their phylogenetic relationships. Although phylogenetic signal is
	a measure of pattern (statistical dependence), there has nonetheless
	been a widespread propensity in the literature to attribute this
	pattern to aspects of the evolutionary process or rate. This may
	be due, in part, to the perception that high evolutionary rate necessarily
	results in low phylogenetic signal; and, conversely, that low evolutionary
	rate or stabilizing selection results in high phylogenetic signal
	(due to the resulting high resemblance between related species).
	In this study, we use individual-based numerical simulations on stochastic
	phylogenetic trees to clarify the relationship between phylogenetic
	signal, rate, and evolutionary process. Under the simplest model
	for quantitative trait evolution, homogeneous rate genetic drift,
	there is no relation between evolutionary rate and phylogenetic signal.
	For other circumstances, such as functional constraint, fluctuating
	selection, niche conservatism, and evolutionary heterogeneity, the
	relationship between process, rate, and phylogenetic signal is complex.
	For these reasons, we recommend against interpretations of evolutionary

	how particular events influenced the arrival of the island's extant
	groups. First we compare vertebrate profiles on Madagascar before

	from the Mesozoic to the Cenozoic in the proportions of Madagascar's
	tetrapod clades (particularly its increase in the representation
	of birds and mammals) are tied to changes in their relative proportions
	elsewhere on the globe. Differences in the representation of vertebrate
	classes from the Mesozoic to the Cenozoic reflect the effects of
	extinction (i.e., the non-random susceptibility of the different
	vertebrate clades to purported catastrophic global events 65 million
	years ago), and new evolutionary opportunities for a subset of vertebrates
	with the relatively high potential for transoceanic dispersal potential.
	In comparison, changes in vertebrate class representation during
	the Cenozoic are minor. Despite the fact that the island's isolation
	has resulted in high vertebrate endemism and a unique and taxonomically
	imbalanced extant vertebrate assemblage (both hailed as testimony
	to its long isolation), that isolation was never complete. Indeed,
	Madagascar's extant tetrapod fauna owes more to colonization during

	assemblage needs to be understood with reference to the basal character
	of clades originating prior to the K-T extinction, as well as to
	the differential transoceanic dispersal advantage of other, more

  abstract = {How, when, and from where Madagascar's vertebrates arrived on the
	island is poorly known, and a comprehensive explanation for the distribution
	of its organisms has yet to emerge. We begin to break that impasse
	by analyzing vertebrate arrival patterns implied by currently existing
	taxa. For each of 81 clades, we compiled arrival date, source, and
	ancestor type (obligate freshwater, terrestrial, facultative swimmer,
	or volant). We analyzed changes in arrival rates, with and without
	adjusting for clade extinction. Probability of successful transoceanic
	dispersal is negatively correlated with distance traveled and influenced
	by ocean currents and ancestor type. Obligate rafters show a decrease
	in probability of successful transoceanic dispersal from the Paleocene
	onward, reaching the lowest levels after the mid-Miocene. This finding
	is consistent with a paleoceanographic model [Ali JR, Huber M (2010)
	Nature 463:653-656] that predicts Early Cenozoic surface currents
	periodically conducive to rafting or swimming from Africa, followed
	by a reconfiguration to present-day flow 15-20 million years ago
	that significantly diminished the ability for transoceanic dispersal
	to Madagascar from the adjacent mainland.},

  journal = {Systematic Biology},
  year = {2013},
  abstract = {Despite being the objects of numerous macroevolutionary studies, many
	of the best-represented constituents of the fossil record-including
	diverse examples such as foraminifera, brachiopods, and mollusks-have
	mineralized skeletons with limited discrete characteristics, making
	morphological phylogenies difficult to construct. In contrast to
	their paucity of phylogenetic characters, the mineralized structures
	(tests and shells) of these fossil groups frequently have distinctive
	shapes that have long proved useful for their classification. The
	recent introduction of methodologies for including continuous data
	directly in a phylogenetic analysis has increased the number of available
	characters, making it possible to produce phylogenies based in whole
	or part on continuous character data collected from such taxa. Geometric
	morphometric methods provide tools for accurately characterizing
	shape variation and can produce quantitative data that can therefore
	now be included in a phylogenetic matrix in a non-arbitrary manner.
	Here, the marine gastropod genus Conus is used to evaluate the ability
	of continuous characters-generated from a geometric morphometric
	analysis of shell shape-to contribute to a total evidence phylogenetic
	hypothesis constructed using molecular and morphological data. Furthermore,
	the ability of continuous characters derived from geometric morphometric
	analyses to place fossil taxa with limited discrete characters into
	a phylogeny with their extant relatives was tested by simulating
	the inclusion of fossil taxa. This was done by removing the molecular
	partition of individual extant species to produce a ''cladistic pseudofossil''
	with only the geometric morphometric derived characters coded. The
	phylogenetic position of each cladistic pseudofossil taxon was then
	compared with its placement in the total evidence tree and a symmetric
	resampling tree to evaluate the degree to which morphometric characters
	alone can correctly place simulated fossil species. In 33-45% of
	the test cases (depending upon the approach used for measuring success),
	it was possible to place the pseudofossil taxon into the correct
	regions of the phylogeny using only the morphometric characters.
	This suggests that the incorporation of extinct Conus taxa into phylogenetic
	hypotheses will be possible, permitting a wide range of macroevolutionary
	questions to be addressed within this genus. This methodology also
	has potential to contribute to phylogenetic reconstructions for other
	major components of the fossil record that lack numerous discrete
	characters.},

	skulls from 441 species in 17 families was used to create a lizard
	skull morphospace. This morphospace was combined with a phylogeny
	of lizard families to summarize general trends in the evolution of
	the lizard skull. A basal morphological split between the Iguania
	and Scleroglossa was observed. Iguanians are characterized by a short,
	high skull, with large areas of attachment for the external adductor
	musculature, relative to their sister group. The families of the
	Iguania appear to possess more intrafamilial morphological diversity
	than families of the Scleroglossa, but rarefaction of the data reveals
	this to be an artifact caused by the greater number of species represented
	in Iguanian families. Iguanian families also appear more dissimilar
	to one another than families of the Scleroglossa. Permutation tests
	indicate that this pattern is real and not due to the smaller number

	observed among lizards with similar diets: ant and termite specialists,
	carnivores, and herbivores. However, these patterns are superimposed
	over the more general phylogenetic pattern of lizard skull diversity.
	This study has three central conclusions. Different clades of lizards

	ecomorphologies in Carnivora were used as a case study. Previous
	research has shown that skull deepening and widening are major evolutionary
	patterns in convergent bone-cracking canids and hyaenids. A simple
	two-dimensional design space, with skull width-to-length and depth-to-length
	ratios as variables, was used to examine optimized shapes for two

	(SE). Functionality of theoretical skull shapes was studied using
	finite element analysis (FEA) and visualized as functional landscapes.
	The distribution of actual skull shapes in the landscape showed a
	convergent trend of plesiomorphically low-MA and moderate-SE skulls
	evolving towards higher-MA and moderate-SE skulls; this is corroborated
	by FEA of 13 actual specimens. Nevertheless, regions exist in the
	landscape where high-MA and lower-SE shapes are not represented by

	of cichlid fishes in the African Great Lakes provide some of the
	most dramatic cases of species diversification. However, most cichlid
	lineages in African lakes have not undergone adaptive radiations.
	Here we compile data on cichlid colonization and diversification
	in 46 African lakes, along with lake environmental features and information
	about the traits of colonizing cichlid lineages, to investigate why
	adaptive radiation does and does not occur. We find that extrinsic
	environmental factors related to ecological opportunity and intrinsic
	lineage-specific traits related to sexual selection both strongly
	influence whether cichlids radiate. Cichlids are more likely to radiate
	in deep lakes, in regions with more incident solar radiation and
	in lakes where there has been more time for diversification. Weak
	or negative associations between diversification and lake surface
	area indicate that cichlid speciation is not constrained by area,
	in contrast to diversification in many terrestrial taxa. Among the
	suite of intrinsic traits that we investigate, sexual dichromatism,
	a surrogate for the intensity of sexual selection, is consistently
	positively associated with diversification. Thus, for cichlids, it
	is the coincidence between ecological opportunity and sexual selection
	that best predicts whether adaptive radiation will occur. These findings
	suggest that adaptive radiation is predictable, but only when species
	traits and environmental factors are jointly considered.},

   abstract = {Morphological diversity is routinely used to infer ecological variation among species because differences in form underlie variation in functional performance of ecological tasks like capturing prey, avoiding predators, or defending territories. However, many functions have complex morphological bases that can weaken associations between morphological and functional diversification. We investigate the link between these levels of diversity in a mechanically explicit model of fish suction-feeding performance, where the map of head morphology to feeding mechanics is many-to-one: multiple, alternative forms can produce the same mechanical property. We show that many-to-one mapping leads to discordance between morphological and mechanical diversity in the freshwater fish family, the Centrarchidae, despite close associations between morphological changes and their mechanical effects. We find that each of the model's five morphological variables underlies evolution of suction capacity. Yet, the major centrarchid clades exhibit an order of magnitude range in diversity of suction mechanics in the absence of any clear difference in diversity of the morphological variables. This cryptic pattern of mechanical diversity suggests an evolutionary history for suction performance that is unlike the one inferred from comparisons of morphological diversity. Because many-to-one mapping is likely to be common in functional systems, this property of design may lead to widespread discordance between functional and morphological diversity. Although we focus on the interaction between morphology and mechanics, many-to-one mapping can decouple diversity between levels of organization in any hierarchical system.},

Here we construct, date and analyse a species-level phylogeny of nearly all extant Mammalia to bring a new perspective to this question. Our analyses of how extant lineages accumulated through time show that net per-lineage diversification rates barely changed across the Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary. Instead, these rates spiked significantly with the origins of the currently recognized placental superorders and orders approximately 93 million years ago, before falling and remaining low until accelerating again throughout the Eocene and Oligocene epochs. Our results show that the phylogenetic 'fuses' leading to the explosion of extant placental orders are not only very much longer than suspected previously, but also challenge the hypothesis that the end-Cretaceous mass extinction event had a major, direct influence on the diversification of today's mammals.},
